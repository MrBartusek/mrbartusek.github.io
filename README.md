# Contributing

While I'm open to small contributions such as typo fixes and minor changes, it's important
to mention that this project was created primarily for showcasing my work and it's my personal
website. As such, it wasn't designed to be contributor friendly, as its main purpose is to
represent my personal journey.

## Translations

Please note that I will only be accepting translations to English and Polish at this time
